Yet Another Low Poly Image Generator

This is just some code to help me figure out how the app [PolyGen](http://www.polygenapp.com/) creates Low Poly art.

I found [image traingulation experiment](https://github.com/snorpey/triangulation) by snorpy a big help and used some of their code. I'm also using [jsfeat](https://github.com/inspirit/jsfeat) for blurring and point extraction and [delaunay](https://github.com/ironwallaby/delaunay) for triangulation.
